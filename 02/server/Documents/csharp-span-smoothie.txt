Span Smoothie Bar
tags: csharp, span, performance

Our office smoothie bar is powered by Span<T>.
We slice fruit without allocation, blend with deterministic latency,
and pipeline the toppings straight into ReadOnlySpan garnish.

Visitors ask if that's overkill for breakfast.
We answer, "Once you've optimized char arrays, you optimize everything."
