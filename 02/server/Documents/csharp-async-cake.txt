Async Cake Day
tags: csharp, async, celebration

Our C# team celebrates birthdays with async/await cake.
We start baking, `await` the timer, and no thread is blocked from eating frosting.

The Java team tried to copy it.
They opened three new threads, forgot to join them, and now pay Oracle a licensing fee for the sprinkles.
