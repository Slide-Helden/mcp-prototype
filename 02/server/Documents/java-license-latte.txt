Java License Latte
tags: java, license, humor

Java developer walks into a cafe.
Barista: "Latte or Cappuccino?"
Dev: "What's cheaper?"
Barista: "Depends... are you brewing with Oracle or open source beans?"

He ordered water; the licensing team still sent an invoice titled "Hot Beverage Runtime Fee."
