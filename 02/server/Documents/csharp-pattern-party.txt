Pattern Matching Party
tags: csharp, pattern, humor

My favorite party game is C# pattern matching.
Every guest walks in and I shout,
"switch expression!"

Someone holds a taco and I reply,
"case { Shell: 'corn', Filling: 'beans' } => vegetarian victory!"

People think I'm weird until I refactor their weekend plans in two expressions.
