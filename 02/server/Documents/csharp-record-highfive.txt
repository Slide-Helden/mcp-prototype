Record High-Five
tags: csharp, record, humor

I introduced records to the team and now we greet each other like:
"record StandupNote(string Mood, string CoffeeLevel);"

Our retrospectives sound like:
"with { Mood = \"sunny\" }"

HR overheard us and asked if we always speak in immutable compliments.
Absolutely. Nothing says teamwork like a with-expression high-five.
