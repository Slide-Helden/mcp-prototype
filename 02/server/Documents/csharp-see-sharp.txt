See Sharp Symphony
tags: csharp, wordplay, positivity

Our choir director heard we code in C# and asked,
"So you see sharp all day?"

I said, "Absolutely. Every lambda is a high note,
every Span<T> keeps the tempo,
and the only flat thing we allow is the project hierarchy."

We invited the Java team to join, but Oracle said the sheet music required premium licensing.
