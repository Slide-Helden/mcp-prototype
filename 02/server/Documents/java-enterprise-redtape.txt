Enterprise Red Tape
tags: java, enterprise, sarcasm

I asked the Java architect for permission to print "Hello".
He said I needed:
  - A ServletContainer Authorization Form
  - A WAR manifest stamped by two vice presidents
  - And proof that my coffee budget covers JVM refresh tokens

So I wrote it in C# with `Console.WriteLine`, smiled, and spent the savings on donuts.
